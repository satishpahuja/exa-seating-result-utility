  <h1>Privacy Policy for CBSE Result Analyzer</h1>
  <p>This privacy policy applies to the <strong>CBSE Result Analyzer</strong> mobile application (also referred to as <strong>Result Analysis</strong> within the app), developed and published by <strong>Satish Pahuja</strong> (“Developer”, “we”, “our”, or “us”).</p>

  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>The CBSE Result Analyzer app does not collect, store, or share any personal or sensitive user data. The app only processes the .txt result file provided by CBSE (via schools’ official CBSE email) to generate a local analysis report for educational use.</p>
  <p>All processing happens locally on the user’s device. The generated reports are stored only in the device’s Downloads folder. No information is transmitted to any server.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>This app does not use third-party SDKs, analytics, or advertising services that collect personal data.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The app is intended for use by school administrators and educators. It does not target children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect any data from children.</p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>Since no personal data is collected or transmitted, user information remains fully private and secure. All reports are stored locally on the user’s device.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Users are encouraged to review it periodically for any changes. Continued use of the app constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
